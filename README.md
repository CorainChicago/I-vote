## Description of project:
i-Voted is a one-stop-shop for voters to get the information they need to register, get to the polls, and select candidates. This mobile-first web app is built in rails and is designed to organize relevant voting information from across the web for voters at the click of a button. Although it was necessary to scour the web, pulling together disparate sources of data to present each user with the information they need, the app presents data to the user in the form of a simple, user-friendly report
